## A description of the project

We would like an app where the user can search for and read reviews of games using an API.
The user would also be able to log in to the app using auth0 and write their own reviews of games to be added to a database.

The user would be able to update or delete their own reviews once logged in.

## The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems

A library of all the games myself and my friends have played, how we rated them and described them, so we can see and play our favourites together and get recommendations from each other in the community.
